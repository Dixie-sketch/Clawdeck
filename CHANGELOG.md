# Changelog

The widget and the companion version independently and are never guaranteed to be the same
version. The wire contract between them is `docs/STATE-CONTRACT.md`, which carries the per-version
detail of every additive field and is the source of truth; this file is the short view.

## Current

| Component | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| widget (`widget/manifest.json`) | 0.28.1 | idle blink every 8–10 s (was 60–180 s). Plus 0.28.0: | **the finish dance**: shades on and a four-beat shimmy when a session lands `working -> done` after a real turn (20 s+), once per 30 s, never beside a waiting session. Plus 0.27.1: | **0.27.0 rendered blank inside iCUE** (property/function name collision, a parse-time SyntaxError); fixed by renaming the reader. Otherwise 0.27.0: | **Approval Pairing Code** property; `decide` carries the code + `requestId`; unpaired taps are refused locally with a notice; 403/409/429 answers named on the panel |
| crabd (`companion/crabd.py`) | 0.29.0 | **SEC-a + WID-a closed**: `decide` requires the pairing code (`~/.sidecrab/panel-token`, minted on first start) and the pending request's `requestId`; `approvals` block in `/v1/state`; `panelToken` diagnostics in `/v1/health` |
| notifier (`notifier/sidecrab_toast.py`) | 0.20.0 | shared DayLedger with the digest; budget-crossed toast; companion-gone-quiet toast |
| lighting (`lighting/sidecrab_glow.py`) | parked | ships disabled: the Corsair SDK crashes in every non-interactive console context tested |
| schema (`/v1/state`) | 5 | marks the last breaking shape; additive fields are feature-detected by presence |

## Highlights by wave (newest first)

- **0.28.1 widget (2026-09-02)** - the crab blinks every 8 to 10 seconds instead of every one to
  three minutes. Same gates: calm moods only, never under quiet hours or reduced motion.
- **0.28.0 widget (2026-09-02)** - the finish dance. When an agent finishes a real turn the crab
  puts its sunglasses on and does a little dance. Bounded: 20 s minimum turn, 30 s cooldown,
  never while a session is waiting on you, never under quiet hours or reduced motion.
- **0.27.1 widget (2026-09-02)** - fixes 0.27.0, which imported but rendered a blank panel: iCUE
  injects properties as `let` globals and the new `panelToken` property collided with a
  same-named function. Import this one instead.
- **0.29.0 crabd / 0.27.0 widget (2026-09-01)** - panel approvals are safe to turn on: the
  pairing code and per-request id close SEC-a and WID-a. `Install-SideCrab.ps1 -PairingCode`
  prints the code; it goes into the widget's iCUE settings. Older widgets cannot approve
  against this crabd (refused, terminal dialog decides) - update both sides.

- **0.28.x crabd (2026-09-01)** - two live incidents fixed: a session killed by an app restart
  stayed `working` and swallowed queued taps (GHOST-a, half closed, taps now refused with 409);
  finished sessions re-activated by the CLI's post-Stop bookkeeping (GHOST-b, closed).
- **0.26.0 widget / 0.28.0 crabd (2026-08-28)** - served context-window denominator, real layouts
  for the sub-3:2 slots, six design-audit findings closed.
- **0.26.0 crabd (2026-08-28)** - backend audit: Origin gate extended to reads (SEC-4), config
  atomic write, GitLookup bounded, needs_input row cap, two permission stand-down P1s fixed.
  SEC-a recorded as the one open security residual (see `SECURITY.md`).
- **0.20.0 crabd (2026-08-27)** - never-500, restart race fixed; widget drill-downs.
- **0.15.0 (2026-08-27)** - the control-surface wave: panel approvals (off by default),
  tap-to-continue, settings from the glass, session filter and density chips, verified live with
  the operator present.
- **0.9.0 (2026-08-26)** - internal-dashboard integration removed; repo genericised for publication; manifest
  id became `com.sidecrab.widget`.
- **0.6.1 (2026-08-26)** - versioning rework: `schema` pinned at 5, additive fields by presence.
- **0.1.0 (2026-08-26)** - first widget package.
